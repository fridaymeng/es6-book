book is about ECMAScript 6 (whose official name is ECMAScript 2015), a new version of JavaScript.\n\nIn order to understand this book, you should already know JavaScript.\n\nThis book covers ECMAScript 6 in depth.\n\nThis book not only tells you how ES6 works, it also tells you why it works the way it does.\n\n\nGlossary\nStrict mode versus sloppy mode\nStrict mode is switched on via the following line (which does nothing in ECMAScript versions before ES5):\n'use strict';\nES6 modules and classes are implicitly in strict mode.\nProtocol\nA protocol defines interfaces (signatures for methods and/or functions) and rules for using them.\nReceiver (of a method call)\nGiven a method call obj.m(···), obj is the receiver of the method call and accessible via this inside the method.\nBindings and environments\nThe ECMAScript spec uses a data structure called environment to store the variables of a scope. An environment is basically a dictionary that maps variable names to values. A binding is an entry in an environment, storage space for a variable.\nDestructive operations\nDestructive operations (methods, functions) modify their parameters or their receivers. For example, push() modifies its receiver arr:\nconst arr = ['a', 'b']\narr.push('c')\nconsole.log(arr)\n// ['a', 'b', 'c']\n\nIn contrast, concat() creates a new Array and does not change its receiver arr:\nconst arr = ['a', 'b']\narr.concat(['c'])\nconsole.log(arr)\n// ['a', 'b']\n\ngitbook serve/build\n\n"},"AboutECMA.html":{"url":"AboutECMA.html","title":"About ECMAScript 6 (ES6)","keywords":"","body":"\nIt became a standard on 17 June 2015.\nMost of its features are already widely available (as documented in kangax’ ES6 compatibility table).\nTranspilers (such as Babel) let you compile ES6 to ES5.\n\nTC39 (Ecma Technical Committee 39)\nTC39 (Ecma Technical Committee 39) is the committee that evolves JavaScript. Its members are companies (among others, all major browser vendors). TC39 meets regularly, its meetings are attended by delegates that members send and by invited experts. Minutes of the meetings are available online and give you a good idea of how TC39 works.\nJavaScript versus ECMAScript\nJavaScript is what everyone calls the language, but that name is trademarked (by Oracle, which inherited the trademark from Sun). Therefore, the official name of JavaScript is ECMAScript. That name comes from the standards organization Ecma, which manages the language standard. Since ECMAScript’s inception, the name of the organization has changed from the acronym “ECMA” to the proper name “Ecma”.\nVersions of JavaScript are defined by specifications that carry the official name of the language. Hence, the first standard version of JavaScript is ECMAScript 1 which is short for “ECMAScript Language Specification, Edition 1”. ECMAScript x is often abbreviated ESx.\n"},"FAQ.html":{"url":"FAQ.html","title":"FAQ: ECMAScript 6","keywords":"","body":"How can I use ES6 today?\nMost of ES6 is already supported in current engines, consult Kangax’ ES6 compatibility table to find out what is supported where.\nIsn’t ECMAScript 6 now called ECMAScript 2015?\nYes and no. The official name is ECMAScript 2015, but ES6 is the name that everyone knows and uses.\nAfter ES6, ECMAScript editions are created via a new process and a yearly release cycle. That seems like a good opportunity to switch to the new naming scheme. Therefore, I’ll use the name “ECMAScript 2016” for the edition after ES6.\nDoes it still make sense to learn ECMAScript 5?\nES6 is increasingly well supported everywhere. Does that mean that you shouldn’t learn ECMAScript 5, anymore? It doesn’t, for several reasons:\n\nECMAScript 6 is a superset of ECMAScript 5 – new JavaScript versions must never break existing code. Thus, nothing you learn about ECMAScript 5 is learned in vain.\nThere are several ECMAScript 6 features that kind of replace ECMAScript 5 features, but still use them as their foundations. It is important to understand those foundations. Two examples: classes are internally translated to constructors and methods are still functions (as they have always been).\nAs long as ECMAScript 6 is compiled to ECMAScript 5, it is useful to understand the output of the compilation process. And you’ll have to compile to ES5 for a while (probably years), until you can rely on ES6 being available in all relevant browsers.\nIt’s important to be able to understand legacy code.\n\nIsn’t the ES6 specification very big?\nThe ECMAScript specification has indeed grown tremendously: The ECMAScript 5.1 PDF had 245 pages, the ES6 PDF has 593 pages. But, for comparison, the Java 8 language specification has 724 pages (excluding an index). Furthermore, the ES6 specification contains details that many other language specifications omit as implementation-defined. It also specifies how its standard library works.\n"},"OneJavaScript.html":{"url":"OneJavaScript.html","title":"One JavaScript: avoiding versioning in ECMAScript 6","keywords":"","body":"On the web, you could tag ECMAScript 6 code via a dedicated Internet media type. Such a media type can be associated with a file via an HTTP header:\nContent-Type: application/ecmascript;version=6\n\nIt can also be associated via the type attribute of the  element (whose default value is text/javascript):\n\n  ···\n\n\nImplicit strict mode\nThe bodies of modules and classes are implicitly in strict mode in ECMAScript 6 – there is no need for the 'use strict' marker. Given that virtually all of our code will live in modules in the future, ECMAScript 6 effectively upgrades the whole language to strict mode.\nThe bodies of other constructs (such as arrow functions and generator functions) could have been made implicitly strict, too. But considering how small these constructs usually are, using them in sloppy mode would have resulted in code that is fragmented between the two modes. Classes and especially modules are large enough to make fragmentation less of an issue.\n"},"CoreES6features.html":{"url":"CoreES6features.html","title":"Core ES6 features","keywords":"","body":"From var to const/let\nlet x = 3\nfunction func(randomize) {\n  if (randomize) {\n    let x = Math.random()\n    return x\n  }\n  return x\n}\nfunc(false) // 3\n\n\nPrefer const.
